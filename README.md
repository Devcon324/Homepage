First Static Homepage
<p>
This page will provide a brief yet detailed discussion about myself and some of the interesting things that I do. This website serves as a first-step project to understanding web pages. the intention is to start with a static webpage designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use features from Bootstrap such as buttons and drop-down menus. Then, learn about Git and GitHub as a version control system to track and commit changes to this site.

In the <b><i>Home</i></b> tab, you will see a few pictures of what I believe best defines who I am and what I am passionate about.

<p>
In the <b><i>Volunteering</i></b> tab, I will list and describe all of my volunteer contributions to the communities I am part of and the activities I have done thus far which have crafted me into who I am today.
</p>
<p>
In the <b><i>Hobbies</i></b> tab, I will do my very best to describe the unique hobbies I have maintained and picked-up throughout my childhood to today. some are niche, whereas some may be commonplace and well-known.
