            <article>
                <img src='Pictures/img1.jpg' id='article_img' alt=''>
                <p>One extracurricular I enjoy is training as a strength athlete in the sport of powerlifting. Powerlifting is a competitive sport where the athletes try to test their strength, technique, and mentality in three lifts: the squat, bench, and deadlift. Below is a table showing the major muscles involved in each lift.
                </p>

                <table>
                    <caption>Figure 1: Table showing the series of powerlifting competition lifts assessed by natonal judges</caption>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Lift</th>
                        <th>Muscle Groups</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Squat</td>
                        <td>Hamstrings, Quadracepts, Glutes</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Bench</td>
                        <td>Pectorals, Biceps</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Deadlift</td>
                        <td>Quadracepts, Glutes, Back</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>I have recently competed at a regional championship level and am proud to have come so far in my athletic career. </p>

                <p>
                    I am an active volunteer in my community and beyond. I work with seniors that have trouble with physical disabilities and dementia. In this roles I visit home-bound seniors and run through several fundamental exercises and stretches to increase mobility and confidence. After several sessions, the positive effects are astounding to see as my clients are able to get up, walk, and go outside for frequently

            <h3><b>Dragonboating</b></h3>
            <img src='Pictures/img1.jpg' id='article_img' alt=''>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Another sport I thoroughly enjoy is dragon boating. This sport involves a team of single oar paddlers that take up each side of a very long boat. At the head of the boat is a team member that hits a drum to the tempo at which the team must synchronize their rowing. This sport emphasizes strength in addition to endurance as the races can take up to 15 minutes of constant exertion from paddling. Although I have taken a short reprieve from the sport, I hope ot return to it one day.
