                <h3>Welcome to my homepage!</h3>
                <h3><b>This is one step towards learning Computer Science and Applying it Through Programming</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Since high school, I have always been interested in creating videogames and computers. This stemmed form my father being involved in back-end server communications technology. In the past several years, I have experimented around with computer science and programming to test the waters and I can say for usre that I am hooked on the subject. I hope to supplement my life and possibly career with computer science with my life-science background to drive an impact in the space of healthcare technology. Taking Harvardâ€™s CS50 is just the first official step in a long line of tinkering around with programming languages during my life.                </p>

                    This page will provide a brief yet detailed discussion about myself and some of the interesting things that I do. This website serves as a first-step project to understandign web pages. the intention is to start with a static webpage designed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Use featueres form Bootstrap sucha s buttons and drop-down menu's. Then, learn about Git and Github as a version control system to track and commit changes to this site.

                <p>
                    In the <b><i>Hobbies</i></b> tab, I will do my very best to describe the unique hobbies I have maintained and picked-up throughout my childhood to today. some are niche, whereas some may be commonplace and well-known.
