                <h3><b>Powerlifting with Team Edgley</b></h3>
                <img src='Pictures/img1.jpg' id='article_img' alt=''>
                <p>One extracurricular I enjoy is training as a strength athlete in the sport of powerlifting. Powerlifting is a competitive sport where the athletes try to test their strength, technique, and mentality in three lifts: the squat, bench, and deadlift. Below is a table showing the major muscles involved in each lift. I collaborate with Team Edgley to help achieve our goals through advice, group training, and exercise planning. I have recently competed at the 2021 Ontario Powerlifting Championship.

                <table>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Lift</th>
                        <th>Muscle Groups</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Squat</td>
                        <td>Hamstrings, Quadracepts, Glutes</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Bench</td>
                        <td>Pectorals, Biceps</td>
                    </tr>

                <h3><b>Dragonboating</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Another sport I thoroughly enjoy is dragon boating. This sport involves a team of single oar paddlers that take up each side of a very long boat. At the head of the boat is a team member that hits a drum to the tempo at which the team must synchronize their rowing. This sport emphasizes strength in addition to endurance as the races can take up to 15 minutes of constant exertion from paddling. Although I have taken a short reprieve from the sport, I hope ot return to it one day.

                <h3><b>Warhammer 40,000: Building & Painting</b></h3>
                <p>Warhammer painting is something new that ahs come up in my hobby space. Initially I started reading the Warhammer books and delving deep into the lore of this science fiction universe. Later, I started painting the models due to receiving a gift from a friend that contained models, paint, and brushes. Now I paint not only Warhammer, but also Dungeons & Dragons figurines for when I play with my friends on weekends.

            <h3><b>Gundam: Building</b></h3>
            <p>
                In addition to Warhammer, I also have built and continue building a Japanese style model called Gundam’s. These models are based on a series of media. Gundam’s are large mechanical humanoid machines that are piloted by humans. The models themselves can range form just 50 pieces to 100’s of pieces involving careful gluing and careful contouring
